WHAT NOT TO EVER PUT IN THE GAME:
- Mech regions, monsters, dungeons
- Story quests
- upgrades that take arbitrary amounts of time

The map can be procedurally generated, but the towns can be pre-made.

Location {
    
    Town {

        Maybe the towns contain special abilities that can only bought at that unique town,
        giving a reason to find more 
        
        Each biome has one town, each biome has one boss dungeon, you must find the town to
        unlock the dungeons location, must complete the dungeon to complete the territory,
        abilites are only ever dropped by dungeon bosses
