# {Game Name Pending}
## Description
This game provides players with an experience to explore and fight in an infinite, vast, and deep world. The world will contain loads of variety -allowing players to embark on many adventures. The content will feature __crafting, group boss fights, permadeath characters, warping, monster hordes, skill trees, items, builds, multiplayer__, and much more. 
## Visuals
The visual style for this game is __top-down, 2D, and pixel__. UI elements will be simple and barebones -whereas game effect visuals will be the focus of most art effort aiming for stunning, immersive, and satisfying PvE content and exploration.
## Language and Libraries
This project is made in the __Rust__ programming language. The macroquad crate is doing most of the heavy lifting for user input and visuals, however this may be switched out for bare-metal OpenGL and SDL2 as limitations arise. 
## Installation
__No additional installation methods are required__. Just clone the repository and compile the different cargo projects.
